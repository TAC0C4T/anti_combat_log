Anti combat log plugin for Spigot.

I saw that no one had a good, simple, customizable anti-combat log plugin so I made one.

Future features:
-customizeable kick command
-in game cli options
-bossbar timers
-more shame to combat loggers


this md document is bad because i do not know how to do markdown it will be fixed at some point
